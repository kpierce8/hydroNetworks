pseudo code

given a graph

1) find clusters
  a) add cluster attributes to vertices
  b) get vertex attributes from nodes info
2) subset largest cluster
3) get ends with betweenness
4) perform topological sort (maybe)
5) get last node
6) find paths from last node to other ends


Code steps
a) need to generate system to carry forward line ids with subgraphs as edge attributes
